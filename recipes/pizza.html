    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kids will love this easy cheese pizza that uses bottled pizza sauce and two kinds of cheese. The homemade pizza crust makes it special.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup fat-free bottled pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup (2 ounces) grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Position one oven rack in the middle setting. Position another rack in the lowest setting, and place a rimless baking sheet on the bottom rack. Preheat oven to 500°.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap from Basic Pizza Dough; discard plastic. Brush olive oil over dough. Remove preheated baking sheet from oven, and close oven door. Slide dough onto preheated baking sheet, using a spatula as a guide. Bake on lowest oven rack at 500° for 8 minutes. Remove from oven.</li>
        <li>Spread sauce in an even layer over crust, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake on middle rack an additional 10 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese melts. Cut into 12 wedges.</li>
